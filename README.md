# Summary of AcademiAI

"AcademiAI : Adaptive Learning with AI, intelligent Ed-Tech platform shaping the future" explores the potential of an innovative solution to transform education. The motivation behind the platform is to address the limitations of traditional one-size-fits-all approaches in meeting the diverse learning needs of students. The existing problems in education include limited personalization, resource limitations, and a lack of engagement and motivation. 

The proposed AI-based adaptive learning platform leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to personalize education. It features intelligent assessment, dynamic content delivery, and interactive learning experiences. The benefits of the solution include improved learning outcomes, enhanced engagement, and increased accessibility to quality education globally.

The solution is built using Langchain Vertex AI API to leverage the utility of Large Language Model for the user assistance in learning a course. On the other hand Flask, a Python web framework, is used for application development. The Vercel platform allows for seamless deployment of the adaptive learning application, providing scalability and a user-friendly experience. The platform represents a paradigm shift in education, empowering students to reach their full potential and shaping a future where learning is accessible, effective, and enjoyable for all.
